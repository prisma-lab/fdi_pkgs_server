# Fault Detection and Isolation of Rotor Faults with a Deep Neural Network 

This repository includes the whole workspace including the ROS nodes for the implementation of the simulation for
the fault detection and isolation strategy presented in the paper:

``` V. Scognamiglio, J. Cacace, F. Ruggiero and V. Lippiello, "Fault Detection and Isolation for a Standard Quadrotor Using a Deep Neural Network Trained on a Momentum-based Estimator," 2024 IEEE 20th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), Bari, Italy, 2024, pp. 730-735, doi: 10.1109/CASE59546.2024.10711689. ```

### Dependencies
To be able to run the simulation create a container using the following docker image

``` docker pull vinsco30/fdi-image:latest ```.

This image contains all the required dependencies.
